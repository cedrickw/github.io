<p> The mail man delivered a <b>box</b> to a house! but the <b>box</b> wasnt at the right home, and it still is outside! How has nobody came and pick it up! Its been there from september!
The <b>box</b> seems to be a gift of some sort, It is under a name I dont recognize. I wonder, do they realize there <b>box</b> is missing, did the sender replace it? </p>
<blockquote> "Its a <b>box</b>, But it isnt mine" <br>
Me. </blockquote>
<h2> This is very newsworthy</h2>
