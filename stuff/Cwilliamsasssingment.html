<h1> Today 10/4/2023 </h1>
<p> The mail man delivered a box to a house! but the box wasnt at the right home, and it still is outside! How has nobody came and pick it up! Its been there from september!
The box seems to be a gift of some sort, It is under a name I dont recognize. I wonder, do they realize there box is missing, did the sender replace it? </p>
<blockquote> "Its a box, But it isnt mine" <br>
Me. </blockquote>
<h2> This is very newsworthy</h2>
